# CSCI_729_Project
Topics in DM project.

This project aims to evaluate and compare the machine learning library in Apache Spark, dubbed MLlib, to many existing libraries in the ecosystem today when used on extensive data. I have compared MLlib against the following libraries: Keras, Scikit-learn, Pytorch, Matlab Deep Learning Toolbox, ML.NET, Mlpack, and Apache Mahout (MapReduce). I chose these libraries not only because they are some of the most popular ones but because of the diversity between each library in terms of programming language and implementation. Each library also can run on a GPU, which provides another possible angle for comparison.
